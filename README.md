# dynamic-schedule

## Description

This web app offers users a dynamic schedule that saves your calendar events to the browser's memory. The calendar display is updated to your current time zone to visualize past, present, and future events.

The app leverages dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and third party API's like bootstrap and JQuery.
